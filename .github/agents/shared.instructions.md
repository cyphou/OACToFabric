# Shared Project Rules — Oracle Analytics Cloud to Microsoft Fabric Migration

All agents MUST follow these rules. They apply to every file in the project.

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Oracle Analytics Cloud source → [src/agents, src/api, src/cli, src/clients, src/connectors, src/core, src/plugins, src/testing, src/tools, src/validation, src/__pycache__] → Extraction → [output, src/deployers] → Microsoft Fabric
```

- **Source**: `src/agents/`, `src/api/`, `src/cli/`, `src/clients/`, `src/connectors/`, `src/core/`, `src/plugins/`, `src/testing/`, `src/tools/`, `src/validation/`, `src/__pycache__/`
- **Target**: `output/`, `src/deployers/`
- **Tests**: `tests/`
- **Docs**: `docs/`

## Hard Constraints

1. **No duplicate functions** — always search for an existing name before creating one
2. **Read before write** — never assume file contents from memory
3. **Test after every change** — run `pytest tests/ --tb=short -q`
4. **Git hygiene** — commit only when tests pass, conventional messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`)

## Python Conventions

- Python 3.12+ compatible
- `unittest.TestCase` for all test classes
- No type annotations on code you didn't write
- No docstrings on code you didn't write
- Prefer smallest change that solves the problem

## Learned Pitfalls (Global)

- Use `elem is not None` instead of `if elem` (Python 3.14 `Element.__bool__()` change)
- `replace_string_in_file` fails on duplicate matches — use unique surrounding context
- Never weaken test assertions to make tests pass
- Stage only files related to the current task
